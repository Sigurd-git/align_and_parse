One month was Chinese take out and I wasn't really happy. A little while after the girls night out I was invited to take part in a book panel on a book panel in California and before the event I was sitting in the hotel bar and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a young dark haired man come and sit next to me at the bar and I suddenly realized that he was one of the other authors doing this event. So I turned and introduced myself to him. I was instantly struck by how handsome he was. He had an amused twinkle in his eye that was instantly disconcerting. We started talking. We talked about books and writing and publishing, and then we skip the small talk and we went straight to the real stuff, to relationships and feelings and life. He was sweet and winsome and brilliant and it was the kind of conversation that you can only really have in a hotel bar.
